# Site sandbox

*alpha.119 · In source and component-tested. Smoke-run once on WSL Debian 13
(systemd 257). The escape matrix on the five supported systems is still
pending in the lab.*

Turkish: [SITE-SANDBOX.tr.md](SITE-SANDBOX.tr.md).

Every customer program runs in one systemd sandbox. That covers the AI and
automation service apps (`celiksvc-<id>`, and their install step
`celiksvcinst-<id>`), Python apps and uploaded programs (`celikrt-<id>`).
CelikPanel treats every program as arbitrary code. An uploaded Go binary can
start Python, so the security boundary is the sandbox. Which languages the
server has installed does not matter.

The code is in `internal/sitesandbox`. Service apps render their units
through it (`internal/serviceapps`). The runtime workstream uses it for
Python apps and uploaded programs. Uploaded programs are described in
[RUNTIME-APPS.md](RUNTIME-APPS.md).

## 1. What every sandboxed program gets

| Area | Settings |
|---|---|
| Account | `User=`/`Group=` is the site's own account, never root. `NoNewPrivileges`, an empty `CapabilityBoundingSet` and `AmbientCapabilities`, `RestrictSUIDSGID`. |
| Files | `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp` (/tmp and /var/tmp are the unit's own and gone after a stop), `PrivateDevices`, `UMask=0077`. The hosting tree is an empty read-only `TemporaryFileSystem` with only the program's folder bound back in. That folder is the only writable path. |
| Hidden paths | `/run/celikpanel` (the Agent socket), `/run/php` and `/run/php-fpm` (every site's PHP-FPM socket), `/etc/celikpanel`, `/var/lib/celikpanel*`, `/var/log/celikpanel`, `/root`, `/opt/celikpanel/toolchains`, `/var/spool/postfix` (with it the `sendmail` drop). |
| Kernel | `ProtectKernelTunables/Modules/Logs`, `ProtectClock`, `ProtectHostname`, `ProtectControlGroups`, `RestrictNamespaces`, `RestrictRealtime`, `LockPersonality`, `RemoveIPC`, `PrivateIPC`. |
| System calls | `@system-service`, minus `@debug @mount @raw-io @reboot @swap @module @cpu-emulation @obsolete @keyring` and `process_vm_readv`/`process_vm_writev`. Native architecture only. |
| Processes | `ProtectProc=invisible`, so other users' processes are not visible. |
| Network | `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX AF_NETLINK`, so there are no raw or packet sockets. `IPAddressDeny` blocks link-local (169.254/16, fe80::/10) and the metadata addresses fd00:ec2::254 and 100.100.100.200. `SocketBindAllow=tcp:<own ports>` plus `SocketBindDeny=any` means the program can bind only its own loopback ports: no other port, no port 0, no UDP. |
| Mail | The SMTP egress block (§3). |
| Limits | `MemoryMax`, `MemorySwapMax=0`, `CPUQuota`, `TasksMax` and `LimitNOFILE` from the administrator's limits, plus `LimitCORE=0`. `LogRateLimitIntervalSec=30s`/`LogRateLimitBurst=1000`. `StartLimitIntervalSec=300`/`StartLimitBurst=5` in `[Unit]`. |

**Additions by kind:**

- **Python apps and uploaded programs** also get `ProcSubset=pid`.
- **Python apps get nothing more** than the base set and `ProcSubset=pid`:
  no `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` and no `NoExecPaths`/`ExecPaths`. An
  interpreter executes its own extension modules from its environment, and
  some packages generate code at run time, so these would break ordinary
  apps. A Python app can therefore start other programs of the server,
  `/bin/sh` included; what they reach is what this sandbox allows. Its
  environment build runs as the transient unit `celikrtbuild-<id>`: the
  same account and sandbox, no listening port, outbound open for PyPI, the
  SMTP block in place ([RUNTIME-APPS.md §18](RUNTIME-APPS.md)).
- **Uploaded programs** also get `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`, `NoExecPaths=/` and
  `ExecPaths=<app folder> /usr/lib /usr/lib64 /lib /lib64`. These are defence
  in depth, not the boundary. They make `/bin/sh`, `python3` and
  `ld.so /usr/bin/python3` fail.
- **Service apps** keep alpha.118's full `/proc` view. Node.js reads
  `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/meminfo`, and this has not been measured with
  n8n and Open WebUI yet.

**Additions on systemd 257 and later:** `PrivatePIDs=yes` (the program is
PID 1 of its own namespace) and `ProtectControlGroups=strict`.

## 2. Per system, and the reduced level

Each directive is written only where the host's systemd has it. Where
systemd would accept a BPF directive but silently not enforce it, that
directive is left out.

| Directive | Needs | Ubuntu 22.04 (249) | Debian 12 (252) | Ubuntu 24.04 (255) | Debian 13 (257) | Arch (258+) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ProtectProc, ProcSubset | 247 | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| PrivateIPC, ExecPaths/NoExecPaths | 248 | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| SocketBindAllow/Deny | 249 + BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF |
| IPAddressDeny | 235 + BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF | if BPF |
| PrivatePIDs, ProtectControlGroups=strict | 257 | — | — | — | yes | yes |
| SMTP egress block | nft `socket cgroupv2` + cgroup v2 | to be measured (nft 1.0.2) | yes (expected) | yes (expected) | yes (expected) | yes (expected) |

The Agent's read-only probe (`SandboxCapsV1`) collects four facts. It asks
`systemctl --version` for the systemd version and `+BPF_FRAMEWORK`. It checks
for cgroup v2. It runs `nft --check` on the egress table, which applies
nothing. It changes nothing on the server.

The level is **full** when all of these hold: systemd 249 or later, BPF,
cgroup v2, and nft can load the egress table. Otherwise the level is
**reduced**, and the screen names each gap:

- `systemd_old` or `systemd_unknown`: systemd is older than 249, or its
  version could not be read.
- `bpf_missing`: the port-binding rule and the metadata block are not
  enforced. The listen check still stops a program that opens a public
  address.
- `cgroup_v2_missing`: the cgroup v2 hierarchy is not mounted.
- `nft_cgroup_missing`: there is no mail block. On this host, programs can
  send mail through the local mail server.

A runtime is offered at the reduced level only when the administrator
accepts the named gap (`sitesandbox.Permit`). The service apps were offered
before levels existed. They run at the level the host enforces, and the
administrator's page shows it.

## 3. The SMTP egress block

Postfix relays mail from 127.0.0.1 without a password (`permit_mynetworks`).
Without a block, any program on the server could send mail as the server.

The block lives in its own nftables table, `inet celikpanel_egress`, in the
native file `/usr/lib/celikpanel-sandbox/egress.nft`. It is never in the
firewall's `inet celikpanel_fw`, because firewall policy V2 is input-only.

- The set `smtp_blocked` (`typeof socket cgroupv2 level 2`) holds the cgroups
  of sandboxed units.
- The output chain rejects TCP to ports 25, 465 and 587 on any address,
  127.0.0.1 and ::1 included, for members of the set. It counts the
  rejections in the named counter `smtp_rejects`.
- The input chain drops new connections from outside (not `lo`) to a socket
  of a set member. A program that opens 0.0.0.0 on its own port cannot be
  reached from outside.
- Loading the file again is atomic and harmless. The table, set, counter and
  chains are declared. Only the two chains are flushed and refilled, in the
  same transaction. The set's elements and the counter survive a reload.
  This was measured on nft 1.1.3 in a network namespace.

Every sandboxed unit gets these lines:

```
ExecStartPre=+/usr/sbin/nft -f /usr/lib/celikpanel-sandbox/egress.nft
ExecStartPre=+/usr/sbin/nft add element inet celikpanel_egress smtp_blocked '{ "system.slice/<unit>" }'
ExecStopPost=-+/usr/sbin/nft delete element inet celikpanel_egress smtp_blocked '{ "system.slice/<unit>" }'
```

These lines fail closed. If nft cannot load the table, or the unit's cgroup
is not `/system.slice/<unit>` (for example, an owner's drop-in moved it to
another slice), the unit does not start.

`celikpanel-egress-guard.timer` runs every 30 seconds. If someone ran
`nft flush ruleset` or restarted `nftables.service`, the guard loads the table
again. It then adds every running sandboxed unit whose `ExecStartPre` names
the file. Between a flush and the guard's next run, the block is absent for
up to 30 seconds. A unit started by an earlier release (with no
`ExecStartPre`) is never added silently.

**Not covered:** port 2525, mail sent through HTTP mail APIs, and a program's
own outbound traffic in general. A program's outbound traffic is also not
counted against the subscription's traffic.

## 4. Native files and owner independence (D-022, D-031)

The Agent writes four files through the D-031 render rule
(`services.ApplyManagedSiteFile`). Each file carries the `# celikpanel-render
v2 sha256=` header. The Agent records each write in
`/var/lib/celikpanel-agent-private/sandbox/native-files.json`.

- `/usr/lib/celikpanel-sandbox/egress.nft`
- `/usr/lib/celikpanel-sandbox/egress-guard.sh`
- `/etc/systemd/system/celikpanel-egress-guard.service`
- `/etc/systemd/system/celikpanel-egress-guard.timer`

The Agent writes an absent file, replaces CelikPanel's own unchanged text,
and keeps a file the owner changed. It places its own text beside the kept
file as `<file>.celikpanel-pending`, and the administrator's page names the
kept file. If the owner's version no longer loads, sandboxed units refuse to
start. That is the fail-closed answer.

All of this keeps working without CelikPanel: the units, the table, the timer
and the guard. To remove the block, run:

```sh
systemctl disable --now celikpanel-egress-guard.timer
nft delete table inet celikpanel_egress
```

The Agent writes these files only during a mutation (installing or starting
an app), never during a status read.

## 5. Proof before publish

When an operation reaches `verify`, the Agent proves the running unit against
its profile (`sitesandbox.Prove`):

- `systemctl show` matches the profile: account, cgroup, every protection,
  memory, tasks, and the egress lines.
- The unit's cgroup is in `@smtp_blocked`, and the reject rule is loaded.
- The unit listens on loopback only.

Any mismatch, and anything that cannot be read, is a coded refusal:
`property_mismatch`, `cgroup_unexpected`, `not_in_smtp_set`,
`egress_rule_missing`, `listens_elsewhere`, `port_taken`, `not_listening` or
`unreadable`. The Panel then stops the app and does not publish it
(`sandbox_proof`).

## 6. Moving running apps to the new sandbox

A unit written by an earlier release (with no `# celikpanel-sandbox-generation`
marker) is never rewritten silently. The domain's page shows "runs in an
earlier release's protection". The administrator's page shows how many apps
need the new sandbox, and has one action:

`POST /api/v1/admin/service-apps/sandbox-refresh {request_id, expected}`

- The administrator sends `expected`, the number shown on the page. If the
  number changed since the page was read, the request is refused.
- The action runs one at a time across the Panel. A second press while it
  runs is refused.
- A repeated `request_id` (a lost answer) returns the first answer and
  starts nothing.
- Each running app gets a durable `update` operation to its own version,
  starting at `activate`. The unit is rewritten and restarted once, then
  proved and published.
- A stopped app has its unit rewritten and stays stopped.
- A unit the owner changed is kept and listed. An app at another release's
  version gets the new sandbox with its update.
- The action is audited as `service_app.sandbox_refresh`.

## 7. Escape tests

The kit is in `deploy/e2e/sandbox-escape/` (see its README). It runs a static
Go probe and a Python probe under rendered units through matrix items 1–17,
and reports PASS only when every attempt fails. The lab round on the five
supported systems is still open.
